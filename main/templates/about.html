<h2>About MyBusTimes</h2>

<div class="terms-text">
    <strong>Is mybustimes data real?</strong>
        <p class="terms-sub-text">No, all data is fictional and created for the purpose of this simulation.</p><br>

    <strong>Can I use MyBusTimes for real travel information?</strong>
    <p class="terms-sub-text">
        No. MyBusTimes does not contain real transport data and is not connected to any live systems. 
        It should never be used for journey planning, ticketing, or real-world travel purposes.<br><br>
        For real world information:<br>
        <a href="https://mybustimes.cc/a/bustimes">bustimes.org</a><br>
        <a href="https://mybustimes.cc/a/transportthing">transportthing.uk</a>
    </p><br>

    <strong>What is the point of MyBusTimes?</strong>
        <p class="terms-sub-text">MyBusTimes is a platform for transport enthusiasts to run their fictional transport networks.</p><br>

        <strong>Who creates the data?</strong>
    <p class="terms-sub-text">
        All data on MyBusTimes is created manually by users - members of the MyBusTimes community. 
        Every operator, vehicle, and route is designed for creative or hobbyist purposes, 
        and none of it represents real-world transport operations.
    </p><br>

    <strong>What does MyBusTimes offer?</strong>
    <p class="terms-sub-text">
        MyBusTimes provides a structured and realistic way for transport enthusiasts to display and organise their 
        fictional bus companies, vehicles, and routes. The platform is built to look like a professional fleet database, 
        but all content is entirely user-created and fictional.
    </p><br>

    <strong>Why does it look so realistic?</strong>
    <p class="terms-sub-text">
        MyBusTimes is designed to resemble real transport systems to make the experience authentic for enthusiasts. 
        However, the data itself is created by users for fun, reference, and creative world-building - not from real-world feeds.
    </p><br>

    <strong>Who runs MyBusTimes?</strong>
    <p class="terms-sub-text">
        MyBusTimes is maintained by hobbyists and community contributors. 
        It is an independent project with no affiliation to any real transport company or authority.
    </p><br>

    <strong>How can I join or contribute?</strong>
    <p class="terms-sub-text">
        Anyone interested in fictional transport networks can <a href="/u/register/">create an account</a>, add their own operators, 
        and share their creations. The goal is to make a creative, respectful, and realistic-looking environment 
        for fans of buses and transport systems.
    </p><br>

    <strong>Disclaimer</strong>
    <p class="terms-sub-text">
        MyBusTimes is a fictional and community-run project. All names, data, and operators are user-created and do not 
        represent real transport services. Any resemblance to actual companies or services is purely coincidental.
